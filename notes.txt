When using Mongo remember to setup the db fom the mongo folder itself. 

In the WINDOWS COMMAND PROMPT goto mongodb 3.0 bin etc
Then create the db and add data. 

Once the db is setup in C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin  ***and you have the right name reffed in your app.js file **fullstack**
var db = monk('localhost:27017/fullstack');

Then you can start mongod from anywhere in bash.
